# Enigmatic — React (Vite) conversion

This workspace was converted from a static multi-page site into a simple React app using Vite.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- The app uses hash routing: `#/features`, `#/signin`, `#/`.
- Original static files remain in the repo as reference.
